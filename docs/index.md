# OpenWEMI [Drafting Site]

OpenWEMI is a minimally constrained RDF vocabulary defining classes for Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item (WEMI) and properties for the relationships between them. It is based on concepts that were originally developed out of library cataloging practice. Unlike the library usage of these terms, OpenWEMI is not defined by any particular community type and can be used as a scaffolding for metadata describing any type of resource.

**This site provides access to drafts, works in progress, and other non-normative resources relating to the specification. Please do not cite resources on this site when the [canonical versions on the Dublin Core website](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/openwemi/) can be used.**
