# Examples
It is probably easiest to define the openWEMI entities through examples. Examples can be simple descriptions, diagrams, code, or however you wish to provide them. Feel free to add examples to this directory.

# Some ideas
## Japanese wood block prints
https://archives.library.wcsu.edu/omeka/items/show/1874
https://archives.library.wcsu.edu/omeka/items/show/1874 This is an archive with Japanese wood block prints. There will be multiple copies, and this one has comments at the item level. You can find more examples of the same print at:
https://ukiyo-e.org/upload/44bc86daa9793109f5f6abf3565a7890
One interesting thing is that some of these are "original" copies, and some are "copied copies", like the photo prints that museums sell.
## Pigment Database
https://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Forbes_Pigment_Database

A database of pigments. Among other interesting things, the entries in this database are housed in a few different archives. I haven't looked to see if there is overlap among them.
## Bodleian Ballads
http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/

"The works represented there have an interesting alignment to FRBR because there are analogues to works, expressions, manifestations, and items, but they don't quite meet the exact definitions under FRBR (e.g a given ballad as a "Work" is not always distinct or even a deliberate artistic creation, because that's not necessarily how the folk process works - but it has many of the same qualities, and then there is also some fuzziness between the work and expression layer on top of that)" from Mike Bennett

This fits with our discussion about performances that can each be unique. Apparently, ballads are not fixed in nature and can have complex relationships to other ballads. The "workness" is not the same as it is for modern created works.

The Bodleian Ballads also can have related images - another possible set of interesting relationships between work-like objects. More about those at:

# Files
## [dcmiWEMI.pdf](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/dcmiWEMI.pdf)
This is a view of the Dublin Core Metadata Terms as Work, Expression, and Manifestation. There are also resource relationships which have not yet been incorporated into the WEM. The file [`dcmiWEMI.ttl`](https://github.com/dcmi/openwemi/blob/main/examples/dcmiWEMI.ttl) is the input to the diagram and defines the entities as SKOS collections.
